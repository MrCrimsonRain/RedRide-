            <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
                <p>My name is Crimson Rain. I am married to a crazy woman. She pretends to be
                a doctor. I think she is a doctor and I pretend she is not.</p>
                <p> I live in MILKY WAY. Maybe crash landed on Moon which in turn
                crashed into Earth. Result was Aliens arrived and native species died.</p>
            
                <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
                <P>I have no prior experice with marriages. Could be a fault of my pretend Doctor Wife. </P>
                <P> I am forced to write a second paragraph. Gaining experience as I Code Along. Which increadibly has no bearing to Marriage</P>
            
                <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
                <P>I have alot of interests and no Hobbies to speak of. I do read.</P>
                <p>I think streaming services are international conspiricy to dumb down the population</p>
